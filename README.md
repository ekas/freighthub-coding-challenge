# FreightHub Coding Challenge

## Instructions to Run the code

- Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekas/freighthub-coding-challenge.git
```

You should now see a `freighthub-coding-challenge` folder in your present working directory. Let's change directory to it.

```bash
cd freighthub-coding-challenge/
```

- Step 2: Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

This will use `npm` that is included with `nodejs` to install project dependencies.

- Step 3: Run the First Test Case.

```bash
npm run test1
```

- Step 4: Run the Second Test Case.

```bash
npm run test2
```

Both Step 3 and 4 will first compile the TypeScript code to native ES5 JavaScript code by a ts-build directory and would implement independent test cases.
